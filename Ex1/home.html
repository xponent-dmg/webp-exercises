            Attack on Titan (AOT) is a popular Japanese manga series written and
            illustrated by Hajime Isayama. The story is set in a world where
            humanity resides within enormous walled cities to protect themselves
            from the Titans, gigantic humanoid creatures who devour humans
            seemingly without reason. The series follows Eren Yeager, his
            adoptive sister Mikasa Ackerman, and their friend Armin Arlert,
            whose lives are changed forever after a Colossal Titan breaches the
            wall of their hometown. Vowing revenge and to reclaim the world from
            the Titans, Eren and his friends join the Scout Regiment, an elite
            group of soldiers who fight Titans outside the walls. The series
            explores themes of freedom, survival, and the human condition, and
            has been praised for its complex characters, intense action scenes,
            and thought-provoking narrative.
